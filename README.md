# I'm Will ðŸ‘‹

I'm a principled engineer with a scientific mindset. I approach problems with objectivity and strive to minimise bias in my thinking and work.

## My Mission

I've become convinced that C/C++ needs to be phased out from embedded systems for security and maintainability reasons. 
That's why I'm passionate about accelerating the adoption of Rust in embedded environments by contributing to open-source projects that make the ecosystem more robust and accessible.

My aim is to be among the many "unsung heroes" building libraries so good that people adopt them without thinking twice about who authored them. 
Great code should speak for itself.

## Balance

When I'm not coding, you'll find me staying active. 
I believe in the power of physical movement to enhance mental clarity and problem-solving abilities. 
This balance helps me bring fresh perspectives to technical challenges.

## Looking to Connect

I'm actively seeking opportunities where my passion for embedded Rust can align with my daily work. 
If you're working on advancing memory-safe programming in embedded systems, I'd love to connect!
